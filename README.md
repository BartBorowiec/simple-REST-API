Simple RESTful API
==================

Hi, my name's Bartek and this is my take on RESTful APIs.

Getting started
===============
##Requirements

To run the app you need MongoDB and (of course) NodeJS. Also remember to install Postman so you can test API's behaviour.

---

## Instructions
Before you start the app you must run mongod.exe to start the database on your machine. It can be found in MongoDB binaries folder.

Open another command prompt and cd into app's main directory, the one with app.js file. From there run 'node app.js'.
If everything is correct you should see this message in your console:
'The API server is running on port: 3000'
